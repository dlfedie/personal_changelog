- Sadly, the AWS server died.. :( Well, I turned it off so as to not incur charges.

- 10 min meditation.
- JAVA

#### Tuesday, November 19th, 2019
- Created an AWS account and created my first server, wooooo! http://18.219.158.201/ (link will likely die at some point because I don't want to keep it up forever and get charged..)

- Java training.
- Read a few developer articles on Medium and Dev.
- 15 min meditation.

#### Monday, November 18th, 2019

- 20 min lower back/leg stretch exercise. Helpful for tall people like myself.

#### Sunday, November 17th, 2019

#### Saturday, November 16th, 2019

- Back stretches afterwards..

#### Friday, November 15th, 2019
- Forgot to post about it so I won't get the green box, but did more Java. Looked a little bit into a Springboot server, because that's ultimately what I want to do.
- Read up on AWS because why do one thing when you can learrn ALL OF THE THINGS??

#### Thursday, November 14th, 2019

- Looking into React hooks.
- Java still.

#### Tuesday, November 12th, 2019
